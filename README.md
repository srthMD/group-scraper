# Roblox Group Scraper

Read the original README [here](https://github.com/Moderation4Dummies/ERP-Scraper/blob/main/README.md) for purpose and background information.

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> **This script is meant to run in a terminal that supports the UTF-8 character set.**  
> **It is recommended to run with the latest version of Python.**  
  
On startup, you will be prompted to enter valid Roblox group ID's as sample groups. Valid ways of input are as following:

* Inputting a single ID at a time
* Inputting multiple ID's at once separated with commas (ex. 34546780, 85773)
* Typing in a command like 'help' or 'list'  

Avoid using letters unless typing in a command, any ID that has a letter will be ignored and you will have to re-input the ID.

When you have input all the ID's you want, type 'done' and the script will run and dump its outputs to a txt file.

## Purpose

The purpose of this is to make the original script more user-friendly and add quality of life changes while also expanding the script independently from the original [M4D repository](https://github.com/Moderation4Dummies/ERP-Scraper).
